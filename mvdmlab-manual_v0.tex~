I didn't change my mind, it changed all by itself.
\end{chapquote}

\newthought{The van der Meer lab} brings together people who share an
interest in how the brain works. We aim to better understand how
learning, memory, and decision-making arise from the coordinated
activity of neurons. In the pursuit of this goal, we perform brain
surgery, design and construct strange mazes, painstakingly build small
devices so we can read the minds of rats, solder tiny circuit boards
to even tinier wires, write thousands of lines of computer code,
collect beautiful data, produce even more beautiful plots, and many
other activities.

\begin{marginfigure}[-4cm]

}
\caption{Some strange mazes. (From Emily Irvine's {\it shortcut} experiment.)}
\label{fig:shortcut}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Each of us brings} their own particular blend of
motivations for engaging in these lab activities, but there are a few
common threads: curiosity about how the physical stuff of the brain
gives rise to thought and to behavior, a love for animals and
computers alike, a desire to help solve some of the big mysteries, and
contributing to human knowledge and ultimately a better world.

\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Our efforts are {\it collaborative}}, not only within the
lab, but also with other labs in the department of Psychological \&
Brain Sciences at Dartmouth. We share equipment, space, and interests
with these labs, and collaborate on joint projects and on creating a
scientifically exciting and supportive culture where everyone can
thrive. We also have joint projects with other labs around the
world. We collaborate because the problems we are trying to solve are
hard, and because learning from and working with others is one of the
great joys of working in science!

\newthought{Working with others} brings not only joy, but also
expectations. Coding and data analysis can be fun, but are full of
pitfalls. Sharing space and expensive equipment with others demands
respect. There is satisfaction in getting an experiment to work, but
it can be a long slog to get there. Perhaps most importantly of all,
the use of animals in research comes with practical as well as moral
responsibilities. {\it This manual is intended to provide guidance on how
to navigate these issues, with particular focus on the van der Meer
lab.}

manual through in its entirety. If you will not be working with
animals directly, it may seem like chapter on

you, but it will give you important insights into how the lab

\chapter{About this Manual}

This document describes the principles that shape how the
members of the lab interact and work. Rather than dealing with the
nuts and bolts of how to get stuff done in the lab, the manual is
about lab philosophy, expectations, and resources. It is an
introduction to the lab.

The lab manual is one component of a larger set of shared documents,
consisting of:

\begin{itemize}
\item{{\it Lab Manual}. You are looking at it. Only MvdM can change
  the lab manual, but he wants to hear from you if you have thoughts
  of suggestions! Periodically, we will review the manual as a group
  at lab meeting to determine what needs updating.}
\item{{\it GitHub
    repositories}\sidenote{\url{www.github.com/vandermeerlab}. Note
    that if you are not logged in, or not (yet) a member of the
    vandermeerlab organization, you will not see the lab's private
    repos.}. These repositories, private to lab members only, host
  protocols and manuals for specific experimental procedures,
  descriptions and computer code for behavioral task control, and
  design files for experimental components. All lab members are
  expected to update content of these repositories. See XXX for more
  details.}
\item{{\it Lab
    wiki}\sidenote{\url{discovery.dartmouth.edu/~mvdm/wiki}}. This is
  a more dynamic, easier to edit resource that currently contains the
  lab's data analysis tutorials. CLARIFY IF THIS IS FOR EXTERNAL
  FACING CONTENT ONLY}
\end{itemize}

We also have a lab {\it Slack} team\sidenote{\url{mvdmlab.slack.com}}
which is used for day to day communication, but it also contains
various documents TO BE CLARIFIED

These different venues reflect an overall organization ranging from
content that is easy to create and easy to change (low overhead,
quick; Slack, wiki), to content that is moderately stable and takes a
bit more effort to change (but easier to track; GitHub), to principles
that rarely change (lab manual). For instance, an idea for an
experiment may be initially discussed on Slack, lead to a draft
protocol that is shared there. Before that protocol is used, it will
be pushed to GitHub. 

\greybox{
\textsf{I assume the lab manual and procedures on GitHub are
  accurate. This means that you should follow all of the policies and
  procedures contained in the manual and GitHub. If you notice
  something that seems to be wrong, please let me know (for the lab
  manual) or change it yourself (if on GitHub). If there is something in
  the lab manual or GitHub that you notice people aren't doing, please
  bring this up at lab meeting, or to me directly. Don't assume this
  is okay (it's not).}}

%%% RESEARCH USING ANIMALS &&&
\chapter{Research Using Animals}
\label{ch:animals}

\newthought{We use animals} in the lab, based on the conviction that
doing so accelerates scientific progess and provides a net benefit to
humans, and perhaps to animals, too. There are many examples of
scientific discoveries that were directly enabled by resarch in
animals\sidenote{Some good examples include the ``Position statement
  of the Max Planck Society concerning the use of animals in
  experiments for basic research'',
  \url{https://www.mpg.de/10882259/MPG_Whitepaper.pdf}}. However,
these successes do not mean we can experiment freely on any animal we
want. The use of animals for research carries a moral, scientific, and
legal obligation to only perform experiments where the benefits
outweigh the costs, where no suitable alternatives are available, and
to care for our animals to the fullest extent possible. These notions
are often phrased as the ``3 R's'' (reduction, replacement,
refinement)\sidenote{Some references on the 3 Rs}.

More generally, research in animals demands that we do the best job
possible, and maximize the usefulness of the research outcomes.

This means that:

\begin{itemize}
\item{We strive to design experiments so the outcomes will be as
  informative as possible.}
\item{We aim to collect the highest quality data possible.}
\item{For the data to be interpretable, records need to be kept.}
\item{We take care of our animals. If animals are comfortable and well
  cared for, they will perform the behavioral tasks we want, be easy
  to handle.}
\item{Data is valuable, and should be protected.}
\item{Data should be shared. To facilitate use by others, it needs to
  be annotated, and stored in a format so that others can use it.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{marginfigure}
\centering{
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/rat_with_objects.png}
}
\caption{A cartoon rat with some objects. Figure from Dudchenko et al.}
\label{fig:rat-with-objects}
\end{marginfigure}

Doing research with animals shapes not only the philosophy of the lab,
but also has pervasive consequences for day-to-day work. Later
sections of this manual, such as XXX and YYY, will deal in more detail
with the nuts and bolts.

In sum, the fact we are working with animals shapes both our lab
philosophy and many practical aspects of working in the lab.

All of these components will be discussed on more detail in the
relevant sections. This chapter is intended to provide some key
definitions, references, and principles.

Animal research at Dartmouth is overseen by the IACUC.

All work with animals (specifically, all procedures) needs to receive
prior approval from the IACUC in the form of
{\it protocols}\sidenote{{\it Protocol}: document outlining the
  scientific rationale, aims, and a set of proposed experiments.}.

Animal care is provided by CCMR.

At a minimum, we are required to log all {\it
  procedures}\sidenote{{\it Procedure:} Any action or change beyond
  picking an animal up in the colony room (e.g.\ for changing cages or
  weighing) counts as a procedure}.

Apart from the moral obligation to care for our animals and ensure
they can contribute to science, we often invest a tremendous amount of
time in each animal through behavioral training, construction of
chronic implants, surgery, and so on. If any one of these procedures
is not performed diligently, then your investment in all the others
may come to nothing.

\section{Everyone}

Values: personal and scientific integrity; respect for animals,
humans, equipment, data, space. Supportive and collaborative learning
atmosphere that fosters personal development, curiosity, exploration,
joy of discovery. For this to count, need persistence, resilience, and
hard work. This is only possible if you are pursuing something you
care about, and take care of yourself and those around you (so they
may reciprocate). Be kind. Non-judgmental, recognize that failing
often is part of science, changing your opinion is better than having
no opinion.

Well-being. Work hard but be kind to yourself and others.

Share your expertise, be respectful of others' time.

Attend weekly lab meetings.

%%% COMPUTING %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Computing}

Computing plays an increasingly important role in (neuro)science and
is central to many aspects of the lab's workflow. The safety of your
hard-won data, the integrity and reproducibility of your analyses and
results, the ongoing development and sharing of the best protocols and
procedures, and the speed with which you can accomplish your goals all
depend critically on correct use of the lab's computing resources.

Because many of these are shared (experimental machines) and/or
inherently collaborative (lab database, codebase) it is especially
important to be aware of the issues below. Experience with some of the
more advanced concepts and tools is a highly valued skill in many labs
and workplaces; mastery of these will set you apart from many of your
peers.

\section{Lab computers}

The lab's computers are a mixture of custom builds (by MvdM), designed
for a particular role, and general-purpose workstations purchased from
Dartmouth Computing Services. The different roles determine the best
way to use each machine. The roles are:

a) single-user machines in offices, one for each grad student/tech/postdoc
b) shared machine in B28, for use with NanoZ and high-power scopr
c) shared machine in B101, for use with the 3D printer
d) shared experimental equipment machines: for recording in B18

\subsection{Single user machines (grad students and postdocs)}

One of these will be exclusively yours to use during your tenure in
the lab. You are free to install software and change settings to suit
your needs as long as any changes (1) do not interfere with the
machine¡¯s ability to support research, and (2) fall within the
uWaterloo guidelines.

Single user machines have a boot drive (C:) for the operating system
and frequently used software. This is a fast SSD drive with limited
space, so be mindful of what you install here. Absolutely do not use
this drive for any documents or data.

Save your work and data files on the data drive (D:), because this is
automatically backed up using RAID (i.e. there are actually two
¡®mirrored¡¯ hard disks which behave as one virtual disk). Run
RaidXpert¡¯s check utility periodically to ensure the health of the
RAID array.

\subsection{Shared machines}

Unlike the single user machines, when using the shared machine you
will need to consider how your actions affect other users. A few
guidelines:

*If need to save your work, create a folder with your name on the Data
drive. Do not leave work or data files on the desktop. If you find
anything that¡¯s not supposed to be there on the desktop or anywhere
else, put it in the lost-and-found folder on the desktop.

*Do not install any software, or change any software and system
settings, without discussing with MvdM first. Do not delete any files,
but place them in lost-and-found instead.

*If you log in to web services, make sure you log out when you are
done.

\subsection{Experimental machines}

The above considerations for shared machines apply. In addition:

*If you acquire data for your project, use correct renaming and backup
procedure when you finish your acquisition session. This is absolutely
essential: data is expensive, and you individually and the lab as a
whole cannot afford to lose any of it, EVER. Do not leave data in the
acquisition folder.

*If you encounter a potential data file or folder that is not yours
and seems lost, make an effort to find out whose data it might be.

*NEVER delete anything that looks like it might be data, unless you are absolutely certain that it has been backed up correctly.

2. All machines, even the single-user ones, use the mvdmlab
account.

3. Machines are distributed across physically different locations. To
facilitate communication and data sharing, we maintain a list with
machine names, MAC and IP addresses, and the network port they are
plugged in to. Remember to update this if anything changes.

To move data between machines, we use freeSSHd, Dropbox, and WinVNC.

The lab database (on mvdmlab-apollo) can be accessed using a SSH
client. 

4. Web services accounts

gmail: mvdmlab@gmail.com
dropbox: mvdmlab@gmail.com
skype: vandermeerlab (for contacting suppliers and other lab-related business)

5. The main lab printer is in B1-282, it¡¯s a HP 2025dn color laser
with duplex (two-sides) printing. Win7 drivers are here; make sure you
enable duplex printing by default. Its IP is currently 172.17.10.7 (a
special subnet that can only be accessed from campus).

Please be considerate when using the printer. Keeping an electronic
library of PDFs using an iPad, Dropbox and iAnnotate is a worthwhile
investment that will make it much easier to find papers and your
comments in the future, and will save a LOT of paper!

The recording computers both have local printers attached for
obtaining protocols and weight sheets.

6. If you see Windows updates to install on any machine, go ahead and
install them. If a computer needs rebooting because of updates and you
can do so safely, go ahead.

7. Use of University computers (which includes all lab computers) is
governed by the Guidelines on Use of Waterloo Computing and Network
Resources. These are generally common sense, and not overly long so
have a look.

e-mail MvdM with the subject ¡°computing¡± and body: ¡°I have read and
agree to the Guidelines on the use of Waterloo Computing and Network
Resources.¡±

\section{Skills}

Growth mindset.

Basic skills: learning about your filesystem, what makes sense to
store where

Learn to use the command line.

Learn to code. MATLAB and Python are the most important. In our
subfield of neuroscience, MATLAB is still the most used, but Python is
gaining ground.

Good coding practices.

Style guide.

Other important software: reference manager, LaTeX if you plan to
write a paper or a thesis. Adobe Creative Suite for making figures.
