abstract = {Identifying the scope and nature of memory processing by the hippocampus has proved a formidable challenge. The major initial insights came from studies of amnesia in human patients following removal of the hippocampus plus neighboring medial temporal structures (Scoville and Milner, 1957). The early studies indicated that this damage spares the initial acquisition of new information, but memory for all sorts of new information subsequently declines rapidly. More recent studies have shown that global amnesia results from limited damage within the hippocampus itself (Zola-Morgan et al., 1986) or including the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and sparing most or all of the surrounding cortex and other medial temporal structures (Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997). These findings indicate that the hippocampus plays a critical role in memory formation for a broad domain of information in humans. Many studies have sought to clarify the nature of hip- pocampal information processing, using neuropsycho- logical and electrophysiological approaches in animals. Among several proposals generated by these studies, one that has captured considerable attention is the view that the hippocampus mediates a neural representation of physical space, that is, a cognitive map (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). This theory was based on a thorough and systematic analysis of the expansive literature on di- verse behavioral abnormalities following hippocampal damage. In addition, O'Keefe and Nadel's proposal in- corporated a central observation about the behavioral physiology of hippocampal neurons, specifically that some cells increased firing rate when a rat was at a particular location in its environment (O'Keefe and Dos- trovsky, 1971). The discovery of these place cells ap peared to perfectly complement the findings on the behavioral deficits, showing that spatial information was encoded within the cellular activity of the very hippo- campal structures that are necessary for spatial learning and memory. Despite its appeal, the cognitive mapping theory, and in particular the findings on place cells, have had limited impact among neuropsychologists who study memory in humans and nonhuman primates. A major source of this limitation has been the contention that hippocampal processing is dedicated to spatial memory in rodents, in contrast to the global memory deficits observed fol lowing damage to the hippocampal region in humans and more recently in animals as well (Eichenbaum, 1997). Furthermore, several recent electrophysiological studies have revealed properties of hippocampal neu ronal firing patterns that are inconsistent with the notion of a cognitive map and indicate a broader scope of information processing. This paper will focus on these studies, reviewing some of the history and basic proper ties of place cells, and considering both early and recent findings that shed light on the content and organization of information encoded within hippocampal neuronal activity. We will call into question the cognitive map account and offer an alternative view.},
